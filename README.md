## Design Decisions

I went with a MERN stack, utilizing RESTful routing, as that's what I'm most comfortable with at home and given the time constraints.

## Trade-Offs 

Given more time...
- I would have gone with a recursive solution. I was able to figure out how to display the data recursively, but couldn't figure out in time how to style/toggle the appropriate parent/children levels of the tree. 
- I would have used Typescript over Javascript.
- I would have attempted to use GraphQL. I started learning it this week.
