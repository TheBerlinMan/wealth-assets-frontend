## Start Up
Make sure the backend is already running. Backend repo: https://github.com/TheBerlinMan/wealth-assets-backend

```
git clone https://github.com/TheBerlinMan/wealth-assets-frontend.git
cd wealth-assets-frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Design Decisions

I went with a MERN stack, utilizing RESTful routing, as that's what I'm most comfortable with at home and given the time constraints. 

## Trade-Offs 

Given more time...
- I would have used Typescript over Javascript.
- I would have attempted to use GraphQL. I started learning it this week.
